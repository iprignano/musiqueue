Musiqueue
=========

Musiqueue is a simple Chrome extension specifically developed for [Last.fm](http://last.fm/). It allows you to bookmark bands you want to discover but you don't have time to, in order to keep them organised and well-kept, just waiting for you to listen them.

This came up to my mind when I found myself dealing with Last.fm artists page invading my Chrome bookmarks bar.  

This is a small project developed by me in my spare time. Feel free to contribute and open issues!

Musiqueue is released under a GNU general public license and it's completely free and open source.

You can find the extension on the [Google webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/musiqueue/cehdihdnjoipjbopomjlaamdbhineicl).
